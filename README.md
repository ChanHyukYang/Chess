# Chess
An all encompassing file which includes functions to generate, display, and change a chessboard, determine legal and optimal moves, classes to help analyze moves whose primary function is to minimize losses via tree traversal, and logic to play against a computer. As white, the player must first enter the numerical value on the board corresponding to the position of the piece they would like to move (numerical values are also displayed above the chessboard), followed by the position they would like to go to.
